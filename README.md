## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that assists students in understanding their chances of getting admitted to a university based on various factors. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and a dataset of past applicants, the project provides insights into the likelihood of acceptance, helping students make informed decisions.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing information about previous applicants, including their GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, research experience, and admission chances. The dataset is stored in a CSV file format and is located in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Evaluation

The project's performance can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error. These metrics assess the prediction model's accuracy and generalization capability. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the `evaluation` directory of this repository.
